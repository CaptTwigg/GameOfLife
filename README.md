# GameOfLife
Python couse 3 mandatory 2 assignment 

In 1970 the British Mathematician John Conway created his "Game of Life" -- a set of rules that mimics the chaotic yet patterned growth of a colony of biological organisms. 
The "game" takes place on a two-dimensional grid consisting of "living" and "dead" cells, 
and the rules to step from generation to generation are simple:

* Overpopulation: if a living cell is surrounded by more than three living cells, it dies.
* Stasis: if a living cell is surrounded by two or three living cells, it survives.
* Underpopulation: if a living cell is surrounded by fewer than two living cells, it dies.
* Reproduction: if a dead cell is surrounded by exactly three cells, it becomes a live cell.
